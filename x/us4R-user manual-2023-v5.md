# Intended Use

The Advanced Ultrasound Research Platform **(us4R™)** is an ultrasonic
system intended to be used in an uncontrolled laboratory setting for
ultrasound R&D, in particular for real-time implementation of new
imaging modalities and algorithms in biomedical and non-destructive
testing applications. [The system is not a medical device and is not
intended for use on humans.]{.underline}

The **us4R™** is a fully programmable ultrasound device built on a novel
architecture optimized for streaming acquisition and software processing
of raw RF echo signals with the help of GPUs.


![WARNING](img/icon-warning.png) | The device can only be operated by users with a base knowledge of programming and fundamental PC skills. It is essential that users read the full text of the instruction manual before operating the device.|

# Interaction of ultrasound

Ultrasonic waves are mechanical waves, which propagate in a medium (such
as liquid, gas, solid and biological tissue). The propagation of
ultrasonic waves is related to the transport of energy.

## Phenomena accompanying the ultrasound wave

The intensity of the ultrasound wave (the maximum pressure value)
generated by the **us4R™** should not constitute a hazard for test
subjects. Nevertheless, it is important to understand how ultrasound
interacts with tissues and realize the possible bioeffects caused by
mechanical waves.

These bioeffects fall within two categories: mechanical -- related to
the possibility of cavitation, and thermal -- related to the absorption
of wave energy by the tissue, which is converted into heat. The
amplitude of an ultrasound wave propagating in any absorbing medium,
such as a soft tissue, decreases with distance. Damping caused by the
absorption and dissipation of the wave leads to energy loss. In the
absorption process, part of the energy is converted into heat.

For a detailed examination of ultrasound safety, please consult *The Safe Use of Ultrasound in Medical Diagnosis*, 3rd ed., edited by Gail ter Haar.

![WARNING](img/icon-warning.png) | The user creating a new transmit schema for the us4R™ should always consider the mentioned effects of the ultrasonic wave in a given medium/propagation environment.
-|-

# Unboxing and setting-up the device

The device is delivered to the user pre-assembled and boxed.

The user must connect the components and perform a setup before the
first use (see: **5 System setup**)*.* The unboxing of the device should
be performed with utmost care.

![WARNING](img/icon-warning.png) | If the device was placed in an environment with climatic conditions that sharply diverge from normal office conditions, it should undergo a process of acclimatization before the first use. This comprises of leaving the device out of the transport packaging for a minimum of 12 hours.
-|-

[The packaging should include:]{.underline}

-   **us4R™** device (with probe adapter) -- 1 pcs.;

-   PC system controller -- 1 pcs.;

-   PCIe cables -- 4 or 8 pcs.;

-   mains power cable -- 1 pcs.;

-   (optional) ultrasound probe(s).

In case of any missing items, the Customer is advised to contact the
Manufacturer.

Before the first use, it is necessary to ensure that the room has ample
space, stable ground and 120/230VAC mains power source with a protective
bonding.

The device should be placed to facilitate a safe operation: the power
cables must be neither strained nor hanging too loose in a manner that
may lead to tripping, wrenching out of cables or otherwise damaging them
through breaking or cutting.

Procedures using the **us4R™** should not be performed if the device is
in proximity to another working ultrasound device. Ultrasound probes can
cause interference, resulting in a falsification of the image.

A proper operation of the device is described in the next chapters of
this manual.

![WARNING](img/icon-warning.png) | The power cables should be plugged into the 120-230VAC/50Hz/60Hz mains power supply with a protective bonding.

solution for you.*

If you cannot find the adapter that suits your application, it is
possible to order a custom probe adapter from the us4us®. Please contact
us at <support@us4us.eu> to discuss the options.

# Power supply connection

![WARNING](img/icon-warning.png) | The 120-230VAC power socket used to power the us4R™ must be equipped with a protective earth wire. It is imperative to ensure that the electrical system provides the fire protection required for the class I devices.
-|- 

A loss of mains power during operation will result in an immediate
shutdown of the device. The **us4R™** will restart once the power is
restored.

![WARNING](img/icon-warning.png) | To shut down the us4R™ in case of malfunction, remove the mains power cable from the electrical socket. The electrical sockets should be situated in proximity to the device and be easily accessible.
-|- 

# System setup

The **us4R™** should be positioned so that operation is safe --- i.e. on
a stable, flat surface in a place with no risk of spillage on the device
and away from the sources of interference and radiation. The external
power supply and power strip should be placed nearby. For more details
see section: **6 Description and general rules of use.**

The heat is dissipating by the us4R-3D system during normal work
conditions and may slightly increase the temperature of the device
surroundings. The ventilation holes on each side of the device must
remain uncovered to ensure free flow of air. Covering the ventilation
holes risks overheating, shutting down or damaging the **us4R™.** The
power and probe cables must not be strained or hang too loosely in a
manner that may lead to tripping, mechanical damage, wrenching the
cables out of the socket and/or damaging them through breaking or
cutting. The audio frequency noise is coming from the fans and sometimes
from the HV power supply during transmit during normal work conditions.
Please consult the Manufacturer guidelines in section **7 Manufacturer
guidelines and conditions of use.**

## Firmware update

NOTE: the **us4R™** system which is shipped to you has the latest
firmware already installed.

The firmware update procedure is built into the ARRUS™ SDK package
installer. As of today (2021/07/29), only the develop version of the
ARRUS package supports the **us4R™**. Follow the instructions available
[here](https://us4useu.github.io/arrus-public/releases/current/python/content/installation/index.html#arrus).

Links to the ARRUS™ SDK package documentation are available
[here](https://github.com/us4useu/arrus-public).

# Description and general rules of use

  
![WARNING](img/icon-warning.png) | The device can only be operated by users with a base knowledge of programming and fundamental PC skills. It is essential that users read the full text of the instruction manual before operating the device.
-|-

![WARNING](img/icon-warning.png) | Before first use, you must ensure that the device is complete and in good condition. Any mechanical damage, spillage stains or similar faults require servicing. Under no circumstances can a faulty or damaged network cable be used.
-|- 

![WARNING](img/icon-warning.png) | Using the us4R™ out of its intended use, or any use that has not been delineated in this manual, will lower the effectiveness of measures put in place to protect the user from danger, and result in a decrease of safety levels.
-|-

The device consists of the **us4R™** device, a host PC computer (picture below), and a set of cables.

![](img/us4r+pc.jpeg)
Fig. 6.1 View of a complete system setup.

**As standard, an LCD monitor and ultrasound probes are not provided by the Manufacturer.**

The **us4R™** enables the user to simultaneously connect up to two ultrasound probes (linear/phase/convex). Two connectors (PROBE A and PROBE B) are situated at the top of the device; For matrix-array probe, an dedicated probe adapter is available with 4x DLM6-360 connectors.
Only a single probe (linear/phase/convex) probe connector is active at a time. An active probe is used to transmit and receive ultrasound signals that are acquired and processed by the system. 

The active connector/probe is chosen in software.

Ultrasound echo signals from the probe are digitized and transmitted via single/dual PCIe gen3 x16 digital interface to the PC, and then further to the GPU cards. Real-time data processing takes place in the CPU/GPUs.

The processed data can be presented graphically on an LCD monitor. The LCD monitor is not supplied with the **us4R™** system and must be provided by the user.

The LCD monitor can be connected to the PC using a dedicated DisplayPort cable.

## Connecting ultrasound probes

Ultrasound probes require special care, as they can be easily damaged by
an impact. The damaged transducers could have internal element
short-circuits or open-circuits, both can cause malfunction or even
breakdown of the **us4R™** transmit circuitry. [Therefore, it is vital
that the probes are handled with extreme care and defective probes are
never connected to the system.]{.underline}

Probes should be disconnected from the device during the transport.

The ultrasound probe connectors are situated at the top of the device.
2D probes (linear/phase/convex) connectors are marked as ***PROBE A***
and ***PROBE B*** on the figure below.

## PCIe ports 

The **us4R™** is equipped with 4 or 8 PCIe ports on the back of the
device.

The PCIe ports are intended for connecting the system to an external
host PC using dedicated PCIe cables. The **us4R™** is provided with a
compatible PC controller that is already equipped with dedicated PCIe
host adapter card.

### Connecting the PCIe cables

The delivered PCIe cables are marked #1 to #4 or #8, to help with proper
connection of the **us4R™** ports numbered 1...4 or 1...8 to the
corresponding ports on the host PC side -- also numbered. [The proper
order of the PCIe cables is essential for device operation and cannot be
changed!]{.underline}

When connecting the PCIe cables you should hear/feel "a click" to be
sure that the connector is latched properly.

![](img/us4r-back+cables.jpg)
Fig. 6.4 Back panel of the us4R™ showing the PCIe connectors and properly connected cabling.

To disconnect the PCIe cables pull the green tab at the bottom of the PCI cable plug (Fig. 6.4).

### Connecting host PC & display

The **us4R™** requires an external host PC with an LCD monitor to function correctly. The only way to connect the **us4R™** device to the PC is through the PCIe cables.

The supplied PC is equipped with one or two PCIe adapter cards -- one at the top, one at the bottom of the enclosure (Fig. 6.5).

To disconnect PCIe cables pull the green tab at the bottom of the PCIe cable plug (Fig. 6.6).

![](img/pcie-cables-5678.jpeg)
Fig. 6.7 The host PC: the PCIe cables #5..#8 connected to the top PCIe interface card.

## I/O ports

The **us4R™** provides four digital I/O signals in the LVTTL 3.3V
standard available on the SMA-type connectors:

1.  CLOCK IN -- input of an external reference clock signal.

2.  TRIG IN -- input of an external trigger signal -- can be used to
    synchronize transmit events with other devices/systems.

3.  CLOCK OUT -- output of an internal reference clock signal.

4.  TRIG OUT -- output of an internal trigger signal -- can be used to synchronize other external devices/systems with the **us4R™**.

![](img/us4r-back.jpeg)


## Power switch, cables and ON/OFF button

The power cables connection is shown in the picture below.

![](img/us4r-back.jpeg)
Fig. 6.8 The us4R™ AC power connector.

## Setting High-Voltage (HV) supply for the transmitters

![WARNING](img/icon-warning.png) | Voltages above 70VDC constitute a life hazard according to EN 61010-1 and great care must be takes when using the power supply at voltages above this level!
-|-

The system TX voltage (so called HV -- High Voltage) is one of the most
crucial parameters from the system/probe safety point of view. Because
the **us4R™** is a research system, it enables the user to change many
TX parameters (TX scheme, PRF, TX voltage, pulse length, etc.).
**However, some combinations of the TX parameters can be dangerous for
the connected ultrasound probe and/or the system itself!** Therefore,
the user is fully responsible for verifying a safe set of TX parameters
that can be used with the connected probe in a given application.
**Application of an excessive TX voltage or power to the probe can
(will) result in damage to the system and/or the probe!**

We strongly advise to use the lowest TX voltage possible -- as low as
reasonably achievable (ALARA rule). Also, please consult us4us® and the
probe producer to get advice on the max TX voltage and power that can be
delivered to the probe.

# Current system limitations

[Here is a list current system limitations:]{.underline}

-   Standard sampling frequency is 65MSPS. Sampling at 80MSPS requires a
    change of system firmware.

-   The us4R driver for Linux is currently in alpha and may have some
    bugs. We are working on resolving the most important issues.

[The above limitations may be removed in future versions of the system
software/firmware.]{.underline}
