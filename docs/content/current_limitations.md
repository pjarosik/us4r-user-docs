# Current system limitations

[Here is a list current system limitations:]{.underline}

-   Standard sampling frequency is 65MSPS. Sampling at 80MSPS requires a
    change of system firmware.

-   The us4R driver for Linux is currently in alpha and may have some
    bugs. We are working on resolving the most important issues.

[The above limitations may be removed in future versions of the system
software/firmware.]{.underline}
