## Firmware update

NOTE: the **us4R™** system which is shipped to you has the latest
firmware already installed.

The firmware update procedure is built into the ARRUS™ SDK package
installer. As of today (2021/07/29), only the develop version of the
ARRUS package supports the **us4R™**. Follow the instructions available
[here](https://us4useu.github.io/arrus-public/releases/current/python/content/installation/index.html#arrus).

Links to the ARRUS™ SDK package documentation are available
[here](https://github.com/us4useu/arrus-public).
